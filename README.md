The purpose is to create from scratch a scoring risk model which could be used into banking establishment. You are going to find in src folder all the .R codes we used to analyse our data, treat it and model it. We separated them to make it easier the group work. Also, you might find a .pdf to explain each steps of the project.

We hope you are going to enjoy our work.
